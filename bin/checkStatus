###########################################################################
#
#  Purpose:  This script will check the given status and make an entry in
#            the mail log, based on success or failure. It is intended to
#            be called from a jenkins project after a step completes. This
#            factors out some repetative error checking and logging into
#            one place.
#
#  Usage:
#
#      checkStatus  status  step
#
#      where
#
#          status = the return status from a jenkins step (e.g. $status)
#
#          step = the name of the step to be included in the mail entry
#
#  Env Vars:
#
#      MAIL_LOG - the path of the mail log that was created by a jenkins
#                 project in its workspace
#
#  Inputs:  None
#
#  Outputs:  None
#
#  Exit Codes:
#
#      0:  Successful completion
#      1:  Fatal error occurred
#
#  Assumes:  Nothing
#
#  Implementation:  See inline comments.
#
#  Notes:  None
