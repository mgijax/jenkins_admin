###########################################################################
#
#  Purpose:  This script will determine which public instance is currently
#            inactive (pub1 or pub2) and echo it to stdout where it can be
#            picked up by the caller. The "GlobalConfig.old" sym link in
#            the /usr/local/mgi/live/webshare/config directory should point
#            to one of these files:
#
#                GlobalConfig.pub1
#                GlobalConfig.pub2
#
#            This is used to determine which public instance is inactive.
#
#  Usage:
#
#      getInactivePublic
#
#  Env Vars:
#
#      - See Configuration file
#
#  Inputs:  None
#
#  Outputs:
#
#      The inactive instance (pub1 or pub2) is sent to stdout.
#
#  Exit Codes:
#
#      0:  Successful completion
#      1:  Fatal error occurred
#
#  Assumes:  Nothing
#
#  Implementation:  See inline comments.
#
#  Notes:  None
